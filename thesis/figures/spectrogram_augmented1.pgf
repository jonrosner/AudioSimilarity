%% Creator: Matplotlib, PGF backend
%%
%% To include the figure in your LaTeX document, write
%%   \input{<filename>.pgf}
%%
%% Make sure the required packages are loaded in your preamble
%%   \usepackage{pgf}
%%
%% and, on pdftex
%%   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2212}{-}
%%
%% or, on luatex and xetex
%%   \usepackage{unicode-math}
%%
%% Figures using additional raster images can only be included by \input if
%% they are in the same directory as the main LaTeX file. For loading figures
%% from other directories you can use the `import` package
%%   \usepackage{import}
%%
%% and then include the figures with
%%   \import{<path to file>}{<filename>.pgf}
%%
%% Matplotlib used the following preamble
